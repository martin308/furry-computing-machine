sample Xamarin.UITests tests

The majority of these tests are navigation based tests. They test that the correct screens show up when you navigate around the application.

It follows a pattern from Selenium UI tests. With "page objects" representing screens that are able to be interacted with in the tests.

There is one test class with all of the tests contained within. All other source code files contain the "page objects" that represent the different screens of the app and which have methods that can be performed on each screen.
